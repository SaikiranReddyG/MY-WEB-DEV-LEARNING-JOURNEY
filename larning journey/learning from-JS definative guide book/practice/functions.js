--functions are defined with the "function" keyword
--function definitions begin with the keyword function followed by these
components:
> An identifier that names the function. The name is a required part of function
declaration statements: it is used as the name of a variable, and the newly defined
function object is assigned to the variable
>A pair of parentheses around a comma-separated list of zero or more identifiers.
These identifiers are the parameter names for the function, and they behave like
local variables within the body of the function
>â€¢ A pair of curly braces with zero or more JavaScript statements inside. These statements are the body of the function: they are executed whenever the function is
invoked
examples are shown below
